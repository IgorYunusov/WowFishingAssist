Advanced features
Some fishing areas have particals floating around, this can cause false positives
to help mitigate this you can filter on color.
for example if all the particals are green,  then you would want to use a color channel that does not contain green
I typicaly use red or blue channel to help filter.

Filters are applied realtime.   motion detection settings need to be applyed.
